StackOverFlowLite
A repository for Stackoverflowlite assignment given to us by Abraham Ogol of Andela. What is This Blog for?

This is Andela-workshop's Stackoverflow test that aims at enabling programmers to ask questions. Once they do that they should be able to read answers given for those questions and also post answers of their own. Stackoverflowlite will see to it that a user is able to choose his or her preferred answer from a pool of many.

My expected learning outcome is the ability to code independently without refererring to existing codes.
